## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework


Program to calculate change

1. The scanner is asking me as the "seller/vendor" to enter price of the item being sold.( double because it is money)
2. input scanner
3. print message asking for price...(double)
4. print the money the buyer gives you...(also double)
5. use if else to calculate whether or not the money given was too much too little or exact using <, > , ==
6. print appropriate messages dependent on if the money received too little or exact.
7. if the money was too much and customer needs change....(change is going to equal cash - price)
8. close scanner
9. create a method that will cast the double (cash) into ints.
10. turn all denominations into the equivalent amount in pennies. ex.twenty dollars = 2000 pennies
11. the formula for that should be int * 100...store result in another int
12. the int with the result in it now needs to be divided by the denomination and checked for remainders using the modulus operator
13. write an if statement that will only allow the denominations used to be printed.
14. print the result......

**** i had so many of the same printlns that i thought i should make a method that would print my result for me.
i realized that a method didn't work well in this situation because i had to declare the method outside of main. therefore i couldn't pull anything out of the previous method, like my formula to cast my change from double to int.
i still left my attempt in the program to reference later.
